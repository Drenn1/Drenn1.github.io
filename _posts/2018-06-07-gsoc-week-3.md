title: GSoC Week 3&#58; R̶e̶b̶e̶l̶ Elasi Scum

The main task of this last week was to implement saving. This had a surprising amount of
nuance to it, since I need to provide ScummVM with various metadata, including
a thumbnail of the savefile, the savegame description, etc... fortunately it wasn't too
difficult to use other engines as templates on how to accomplish this. I'm quite glad
I found out about ScummVM's built-in serializer before starting on this, as it reduces the
amount of redundant code by a lot (saving and loading is done with the same code).

The main issue I encountered, was a portability concern. I can't simply memcpy a data
structure to save it, since there are no guarantees about struct packing, or endianness,
etc... so, I need to specify each individual variable that goes into the savefile. This is
a huge pain to do, since each individual room has its own set of variables, and I'm still
figuring out what they are. I've mostly held off on saving room-specific variables for
now. Hopefully I'll find a better solution, but obviously I must eventually solve this for
saves to work properly.

In the meantime, the next mission is coming along, in which Kirk faces off against the
Elasi - some kind of "rebel alliance", except, they're the bad guys.
